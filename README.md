## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a variety of data structure programs that cover fundamental concepts taught in BSc Sem III Computer Science at RTM Nagpur University. These programs are intended to enhance your understanding of data structures and algorithms through practical implementation.

## Usage

To use the programs in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using command:
   ```git clone https://github.com/Chetan-Raut/Data-Structures-4-BSc.git```
 
3. Navigate to the appropriate program directory using a terminal or code editor.

4. Compile and run the program using a suitable compiler or integrated development environment (IDE).

5. Study the code and experiment with different inputs to gain a better understanding of the data structure and algorithm being demonstrated.
